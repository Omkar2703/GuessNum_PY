#Creating A Guessing Game In Python

Today we are going to make an interactive guessing game in Python.

This is going to be a simple guessing game where the computer will generate a random number between 1 to 10, and the user has to guess it in 5 attempts.

Based on the user's guess computer will give various hints if the number is high or low. When the user guess matches the number computer will print the answer along with the number of attempts.

This is how the game looks in action,
